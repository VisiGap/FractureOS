1.2 "View-Only" means the act of accessing and rendering the Software for the purpose of viewing, evaluating, or demonstration. It does not include running in a production environment, integration, development, testing (other than rendering purely for display), commercial use, distribution, or any other form of exploitation.
1.3 "Temporary Technical Copies" means brief copies that are strictly necessary and automatically generated by a device or Hosting Platform for the purpose of rendering, caching, indexing, or backup.
2. Grant of Rights
Subject to your full compliance with all terms of this License, the Licensor grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, non-sublicensable right solely to:
(a) access the Software for View-Only purposes; and
(b) make Temporary Technical Copies (including device cache, CDN cache, search index, and automated backups) that are strictly necessary to enable such viewing and rendering.
No other rights are granted except as expressly set forth herein.
3. Restrictions
You may not, and you may not permit any third party to:
3.1 Use the Software in a production or development environment;

4. Platform Compatibility
To the extent that they do not conflict with this License, this License does not restrict the technical processing and caching necessary for a Hosting Platform to provide its services.

6. Confidentiality
If the Software, or any part thereof, is marked as or would reasonably be considered confidential information, you shall protect it with a degree of care no less than the reasonable care you use for your own similar information. You may use it only for the purposes described in Section 2. If compelled by law to disclose, you must provide the Licensor with prior notice where feasible.
